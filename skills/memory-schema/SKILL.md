# Memory Schema

Manage structured note types using Basic Memory's Picoschema system. Schemas define what fields a note type should have, making notes uniform, queryable, and validatable.

## When to Use

- **New note type emerging** — you notice several notes share the same structure (meetings, people, decisions)
- **Validation check** — confirm existing notes conform to their schema
- **Schema drift** — detect fields that notes use but the schema doesn't define (or vice versa)
- **Schema evolution** — add/remove/change fields as requirements evolve
- **On demand** — user asks to create, check, or manage schemas

## Picoschema Syntax Reference

Schemas are defined in YAML frontmatter using Picoschema — a compact notation for describing note structure.

### Basic Types

```yaml
schema:
  name: string, person's full name
  age: integer, age in years
  score: number, floating-point rating
  active: boolean, whether currently active
```

Supported types: `string`, `integer`, `number`, `boolean`.

### Optional Fields

Append `?` to the field name:

```yaml
schema:
  title: string, required field
  subtitle?: string, optional field
```

### Enums

Use `(enum)` with a list of allowed values:

```yaml
schema:
  status(enum): [active, blocked, done, abandoned], current state
```

Optional enum:

```yaml
schema:
  priority?(enum): [low, medium, high, critical], task priority
```

### Arrays

Use `(array)` for list fields:

```yaml
schema:
  tags(array): string, categorization labels
  steps?(array): string, ordered steps to complete
```

### Relations

Reference other entity types directly:

```yaml
schema:
  parent_task?: Task, parent task if this is a subtask
  attendees?(array): Person, people who attended
```

Relations create edges in the knowledge graph, linking notes together.

### Validation Settings

```yaml
settings:
  validation: warn    # warn (log issues) or error (strict)
```

### Complete Example

```yaml
---
title: Meeting
type: schema
entity: Meeting
version: 1
schema:
  topic: string, what was discussed
  date: string, when it happened (YYYY-MM-DD)
  attendees?(array): Person, who attended
  decisions?(array): string, decisions made
  action_items?(array): string, follow-up tasks
  status?(enum): [scheduled, completed, cancelled], meeting state
settings:
  validation: warn
---
```

## Discovering Unschemaed Notes

Look for clusters of notes that share structure but have no schema:

1. **Search by type**: `search_notes(query="type:Meeting")` — if many notes share a `type` but no `schema/Meeting.md` exists, it's a candidate.

2. **Infer a schema**: Use `schema_infer` to analyze existing notes and generate a suggested schema:
   ```
   schema_infer(noteType="Meeting")
   schema_infer(noteType="Meeting", threshold=0.5)  // fields in 50%+ of notes
   ```
   The threshold (0.0–1.0) controls how common a field must be to be included. Default is usually fine; lower it to catch rarer fields.

3. **Review the suggestion** — the inferred schema shows field names, types, and frequency. Decide which fields to keep, make optional, or drop.

## Creating a Schema

Write the schema note to `schema/<EntityName>`:

```
write_note(
    title="Meeting",
    folder="schema",
    content="---
title: Meeting
type: schema
entity: Meeting
version: 1
schema:
  topic: string, what was discussed
  date: string, when it happened
  attendees?(array): Person, who attended
  decisions?(array): string, decisions made
settings:
  validation: warn

# Meeting

Schema for meeting notes.

## Observations
- [convention] Meeting notes live in memory/meetings/ or as daily entries
- [convention] Always include date and topic
- [convention] Action items should become tasks when complex",
)
```

### Key Principles

- **Schema notes live in `schema/`** — one note per entity type
- **`type: schema`** in frontmatter marks it as a schema definition
- **`entity: Meeting`** names the type it applies to
- **`version: 1`** — increment when making breaking changes
- **`settings.validation: warn`** is recommended to start — it logs issues without blocking writes

## Validating Notes

Check how well existing notes conform to their schema:

```
// Validate all notes of a type
schema_validate(noteType="Meeting")

// Validate a single note
schema_validate(identifier="meetings/2026-02-10-standup")
```

Validation reports:
- **Missing required fields** — the note lacks a field the schema requires
- **Unknown fields** — the note has fields the schema doesn't define
- **Type mismatches** — a field value doesn't match the expected type
- **Invalid enum values** — a value isn't in the allowed set

### Handling Validation Results

- **`warn` mode**: Review warnings periodically. Fix notes that are clearly wrong; add optional fields to the schema for legitimate new patterns.
- **`error` mode**: Use for strict schemas where conformance matters (e.g., automated pipelines consuming notes).

## Detecting Drift

Over time, notes evolve and schemas lag behind. Use `schema_diff` to find divergence:

```
schema_diff(noteType="Meeting")
```

Diff reports:
- **Fields in notes but not in schema** — candidates for adding to the schema (as optional)
- **Schema fields rarely used** — consider making optional or removing
- **Type inconsistencies** — fields used as different types across notes

## Schema Evolution

When note structure changes:

1. **Run diff** to see current state: `schema_diff(noteType="Meeting")`
2. **Update the schema note** via `edit_note`:
   ```
   edit_note(
       identifier="schema/Meeting",
       operation="find_replace",
       find_text="version: 1",
       content="version: 2",
       expected_replacements=1,
   )
   ```
3. **Add/remove/modify fields** in the `schema:` block
4. **Re-validate** to confirm existing notes still pass: `schema_validate(noteType="Meeting")`
5. **Fix outliers** — update notes that don't conform to the new schema

### Evolution Guidelines

- **Additive changes** (new optional fields) are safe — no version bump needed
- **Breaking changes** (new required fields, removed fields, type changes) should bump `version`
- **Prefer optional over required** — most fields should be optional to start
- **Don't over-constrain** — schemas should describe common structure, not enforce rigid templates
- **Schema as documentation** — even if validation is set to `warn`, the schema serves as living documentation for what notes of that type should contain

## Workflow Summary

```
1. Notice repeated note structure → infer schema (schema_infer)
2. Review + create schema note   → write to schema/ (write_note)
3. Validate existing notes       → check conformance (schema_validate)
4. Fix outliers                  → edit non-conforming notes (edit_note)
5. Periodically check drift      → detect divergence (schema_diff)
6. Evolve schema as needed       → update schema note (edit_note)
```
