# 2026-02-07 — Friday

## Observations
- [date] 2026-02-07
- [type] daily-note

## Standup
- Maya: Linear webhook handler parsing all issue lifecycle events — cycle time MVP by next week
- Raj: webhook queue stable at 500 evt/sec, working on disk-backed overflow
- Lena: onboarding wireframes approved by Maya, starting high-fidelity mockups

## Release: v0.8.3-rc.1
- Includes Raj's timezone cache fix (STL-145) and WAL mode optimization (STL-131)
- Also fixes Windows timezone bug (STL-134)
- Running in RC for the weekend, targeting Monday for stable release
- fasttrack_dev volunteered to test the RC — great community member

## Customer Call: Cortex AI (Intro)
- Maya had 20-min intro call with James Liu (CTO, Cortex AI)
- They're frustrated with manual DORA metrics tracking (spreadsheet-based)
- Want: deployment frequency, lead time, cycle time — the full DORA suite
- Team size: 8 engineers, using GitHub Actions for CI/CD
- James wants a deeper demo — scheduled for Feb 18 at 10am PST
- Maya: "If we land Cortex AI, that's $72/mo and a great logo for the YC crowd"

## Architecture Discussion: Rate Limit Strategy
- Maya and Raj debated how to handle Linear's 100 req/min limit
- Option A: Token bucket with sliding window (complex but precise)
- Option B: Simple delay between requests with exponential backoff on 429
- Decided on Option B for MVP — simpler, good enough for now
- Raj will implement as part of STL-139

## Weekend Plans
- I'll run the full test suite against v0.8.3-rc.1 overnight
- Maya heading to a founder dinner in SF — might network for enterprise leads
- Raj taking Saturday off, back Sunday for the RC validation
