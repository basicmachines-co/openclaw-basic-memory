# 2026-02-04 — Tuesday

## Observations
- [date] 2026-02-04
- [type] daily-note

## Standup
- Maya writing Linear OAuth integration — need workspace-level token with read:issues scope
- Raj finished WAL mode optimization (STL-131) — 4x improvement on concurrent reads
- Lena compiled onboarding analytics: 62% of users drop off at step 4 (email verification)

## Architecture: Webhook Ingestion Design
- Maya shared RFC in Slack: "Webhook Queue Architecture for Linear Events"
- Key points:
  - Async queue with configurable depth
  - Events persisted to SQLite before processing (crash recovery)
  - Idempotent handlers keyed on event ID
  - Dead letter queue for failed processing after 3 retries
- Raj reviewed and approved — suggested adding disk-backed overflow for burst scenarios
- Will implement over the next week

## Customer Interaction
- Demo call with a 5-person startup called "Veloce" — they use GitHub + Linear
- Liked the CLI-first approach, concerned about no web dashboard for managers
- Maya: "We have the cloud dashboard at app.stellartools.dev, it's just secondary to CLI"
- They'll start a trial this week

## Bug
- STL-134: `stl metrics --since` flag ignoring timezone offset on Windows
- Raj investigating — likely same class of bug as the timezone cache issue
- Low priority, only affects ~3% of users (Windows CLI users)
