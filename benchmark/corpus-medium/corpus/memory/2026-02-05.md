# 2026-02-05 — Wednesday

## Observations
- [date] 2026-02-05
- [type] daily-note

## Standup
- Maya got Linear OAuth working — can pull workspace data and issue lists
- Raj prototyping the async webhook queue in Rust (using tokio channels)
- Lena wireframing simplified onboarding — targeting 3 steps max

## Competitive Research
- Swarmia just announced Linear integration in their blog post
- Their approach: polling API every 5 minutes — no webhooks
- Our webhook-based approach will give near-real-time metrics — significant advantage
- Maya: "This validates our roadmap. Ship fast."

## Community
- GitHub issue #287 from user "fasttrack_dev": timezone bug affecting `stl report` command
- They provided a detailed repro with screenshots — really helpful
- Same root cause as STL-134 — cache key doesn't include TZ offset
- Raj prioritizing this for the next patch release

## Security Review
- Ran `cargo audit` — flagged hyper v0.14.28 (RUSTSEC-2024-0421)
- HTTP request smuggling vulnerability in certain proxy configurations
- Not critical for us (we don't proxy) but should upgrade to hyper v1.x
- Added to backlog as STL-138

## Pricing Chat
- Maya mentioned she's been thinking about free tier limits
- Current: unlimited repos for solo devs, $9/seat for teams
- Concern: some "solo" users are clearly small teams gaming the system
- No decision yet — she wants to see usage data first
