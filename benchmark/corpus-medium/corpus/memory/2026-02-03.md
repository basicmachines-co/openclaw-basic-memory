# 2026-02-03 — Monday

## Observations
- [date] 2026-02-03
- [type] daily-note

## Standup
- Maya starting Linear webhook integration design doc — goal is real-time cycle time metrics
- Raj working on SQLite WAL mode optimizations (STL-131) — concurrent reads during aggregation are slow
- Lena auditing current onboarding flow, collecting drop-off data from Posthog

## Metrics
- MRR: $1,950
- Active teams: 59
- GitHub stars: 1,782
- Trial signups last week: 14
- Trial-to-paid conversion: 21%

## Customer Feedback
- Support ticket from Nexus Labs: their 12-seat team hitting slow query times on the dashboard
- Root cause: missing index on `metrics.team_id` column (STL-133)
- Raj patched and deployed within 2 hours

## Discussion: Integration Priorities
- Maya wants Linear first, then Jira
- Raj suggests adding Slack integration for standup summaries
- Decided: Linear is top priority for Feb — Jira and Slack pushed to March
- Linear API docs reviewed — rate limit is 100 req/min, webhook support is solid

## Evening
- Read through Linear's webhook documentation — they support all issue lifecycle events
- Started scaffolding the webhook handler module in `src/integrations/linear/`
