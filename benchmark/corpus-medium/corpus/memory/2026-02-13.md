# 2026-02-13 — Thursday

## Observations
- [date] 2026-02-13
- [type] daily-note

## Standup
- Maya polishing Linear integration — cycle time accuracy improved after handling re-opened issues
- Raj finished exponential backoff for Linear API rate limiting (STL-139) — merged and closed
- Lena onboarding UI at 50%, OAuth PKCE flow still pending from Raj

## Linear API Rate Limiting — Done
- Raj shipped the fix for STL-139 today
- Exponential backoff with jitter: base 1s, max 30s, jitter ±500ms
- Also added request batching — can now fetch up to 50 issues per request via GraphQL
- Tested against a workspace with 12,000 issues — stays within rate limits comfortably
- Closes the rate limiting task

## Customer: Cortex AI Demo Prep
- James Liu emailed confirming the Feb 18 demo — 10am PST
- He's bringing their VP Eng (Sarah Park) to the call
- Maya wants to show: Linear integration, cycle time metrics, CLI workflow
- Need to set up a demo workspace with realistic data
- Created a prep checklist — Atlas to help seed demo data this weekend

## Incident Follow-up
- Reviewed the Feb 12 webhook queue backup with fresh eyes
- The backpressure fix is working — tested with 3,000 event burst, queue stayed stable
- Disk-backed overflow kicked in at 5,000 events, no data loss
- Still need to add alerting (Maya's action item from postmortem)

## GitHub Stars
- Hit 1,860 — up 13 this week
- The HN thread about CLI productivity tools is driving traffic
- fasttrack_dev shared our tool in a Reddit r/rust thread — nice organic growth
