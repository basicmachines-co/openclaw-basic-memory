# 2026-02-16 — Sunday

## Observations
- [date] 2026-02-16
- [type] daily-note

## Demo Polish
- Refined Cortex AI demo script based on Maya's feedback (she reviewed via Slack)
- Added a section showing DORA metrics view — James specifically asked about deployment frequency
- Deployment frequency requires GitHub Actions webhook — hacked together a quick prototype
- Not production-ready but enough for demo purposes

## Load Testing Setup
- Started setting up load testing framework per postmortem action item
- Using `drill` (Rust-based HTTP load testing tool) — fits our stack
- Initial script simulates 100 concurrent webhook producers at 50 events/sec each
- Target: queue should handle 5,000 events/sec without degradation
- Current result: stable at 2,000 events/sec, starts dropping at 3,500
- Need to profile the SQLite write path — likely the bottleneck

## Community
- fasttrack_dev opened a PR (#291) adding fish shell completions for `stl`
- Clean code, good tests — will review and merge Monday
- They're becoming a regular contributor — might be worth inviting to a private beta channel

## GitHub Stats
- Stars: 1,871 (another 11 over the weekend)
- Open issues: 23 (down from 28 last week)
- PR backlog: 4 (including fasttrack_dev's fish completions)
