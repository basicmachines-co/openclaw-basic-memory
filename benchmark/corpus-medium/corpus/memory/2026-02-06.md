# 2026-02-06 — Thursday

## Observations
- [date] 2026-02-06
- [type] daily-note

## Standup
- Maya parsing Linear webhook payloads — cycle time calculation logic is tricky (need to handle re-opened issues)
- Raj has webhook queue prototype working with tokio — hitting 500 events/sec on local benchmark
- Lena shared onboarding wireframes in Figma — clean 3-step flow

## Linear API Rate Limiting Research
- Maya hit the 100 req/min rate limit during testing with a large workspace
- Linear returns 429 with `Retry-After` header
- Current retry logic is linear (1s, 2s, 3s) — need exponential backoff
- Created STL-139: implement exponential backoff with jitter for Linear API
- Also need to batch issue fetches — currently fetching one at a time

## Onboarding Data Deep Dive
- Lena pulled full funnel from Posthog:
  - Step 1 (Install CLI): 100% (by definition)
  - Step 2 (Create account): 89%
  - Step 3 (Verify email): 71%
  - Step 4 (Create team): 52%
  - Step 5 (Invite members): 38%
  - Step 6 (Connect GitHub): 34%
  - Step 7 (View dashboard): 28%
- Biggest drop: step 3→4 (email verification) and step 5→6 (GitHub OAuth)
- New flow targets: Install → Connect GitHub → See metric = 3 steps
- If we can get 60%+ to complete, that's a massive improvement

## Customer: Cortex AI Discovery
- Got a trial signup from Cortex AI — 8-person eng team
- They're a YC W26 company building AI code review tools
- CTO is James Liu — found us through Hacker News
- Using GitHub + Linear, which is perfect for our stack
- Maya wants to reach out personally for a white-glove onboarding
