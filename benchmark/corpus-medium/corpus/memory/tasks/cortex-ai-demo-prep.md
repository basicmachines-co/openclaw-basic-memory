# Cortex AI Demo Prep

## Observations
- [description] Prepare demo environment and script for Cortex AI meeting on Feb 18 at 10am PST
- [status] active
- [assigned_to] Maya Chen
- [current_step] 4
- [priority] high
- [target_date] 2026-02-18

## Steps
1. [x] Seed demo workspace with 6 months of synthetic Linear data (450 issues)
2. [x] Create demo script: init → metrics → report → cloud dashboard
3. [x] Add DORA metrics section (deployment frequency via GitHub Actions webhook prototype)
4. [ ] Dry run with Maya on Monday morning
5. [ ] Run the demo call (Feb 18, 10am PST)

## Context
- Cortex AI: YC W26 company, AI code review tools, 8-person eng team
- CTO James Liu + VP Eng Sarah Park attending
- They want DORA metrics: deployment frequency, lead time, cycle time
- Currently tracking manually in spreadsheets
- Demo data: 450 issues, median cycle time 2.3d, p95 8.1d
- Deployment frequency prototype is demo-only (not production-ready)
- If they convert: $72/mo (8 seats × $9)
- Strategic value: YC logo, potential referrals to other W26 companies
