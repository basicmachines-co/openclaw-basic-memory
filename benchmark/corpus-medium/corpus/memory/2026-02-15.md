# 2026-02-15 — Saturday

## Observations
- [date] 2026-02-15
- [type] daily-note

## Weekend Work: Demo Prep
- Seeded demo workspace with 6 months of synthetic issue data for Cortex AI demo
- Created 450 issues across 3 Linear projects with realistic cycle times
- Cycle time distribution: median 2.3 days, p95 8.1 days — looks believable
- Demo script draft:
  1. `stl init` — connect to Linear workspace (30 sec)
  2. `stl metrics --team backend --period 30d` — show cycle time + throughput
  3. `stl report --format markdown` — generate weekly eng report
  4. Show cloud dashboard at app.stellartools.dev for non-CLI users

## Incident Runbook — Draft Complete
- Finished the incident response runbook (postmortem action item)
- Covers: webhook queue backup, database connection exhaustion, API rate limiting
- Published to internal docs at docs.stellartools.dev/runbook
- Will share with team Monday for review

## Pricing Analysis
- Pulled usage data Maya requested for the free tier discussion
- Findings:
  - 340 solo (free) users total
  - 12 "solo" users have >5 repos and >3 active contributors — likely small teams
  - These 12 accounts generate 18% of our API traffic but pay $0
  - If we capped free tier at 3 repos: ~30 users affected, ~8 would likely convert
  - Estimated revenue impact: +$200-400/mo MRR
- Maya will review Monday
