# Competitive Landscape

## Observations
- [researched] 2026-02-08
- [updated] 2026-02-12
- [market] developer productivity / engineering metrics

## Competitors

### LinearB
- Enterprise focused, $30/seat/month
- Heavy setup, requires admin access to everything
- Good DORA metrics but overkill for small teams
- Funded: $71M raised
- Weakness: expensive, complex onboarding

### Sleuth
- DORA metrics specialist
- SaaS only, no local/CLI option
- Good Slack integration
- Weakness: narrow focus, no project management integration

### Swarmia
- Best UX in the category
- GitHub-only (no Linear, no Jira)
- Engineering insights + goal tracking
- Weakness: GitHub lock-in, no CLI, cloud-only

### Waydev
- Enterprise analytics, AI-powered
- Focus on "developer performance" (controversial framing)
- Weakness: perception as surveillance tool

## Our Positioning
- CLI-first: works in the terminal where developers already live
- Single binary: no Docker, no cloud dependency
- Privacy-respecting: metrics stay local by default
- Integration breadth: GitHub + Linear (Jira post-v1)
- Price: $9/seat — 70% cheaper than LinearB

## Moat
- Offline capability (works on planes, in restricted networks)
- Rust single binary — zero dependencies for end users
- Growing open-source community (1,847 stars)
- Trust: local-first means companies trust us with sensitive code metrics

## Relations
