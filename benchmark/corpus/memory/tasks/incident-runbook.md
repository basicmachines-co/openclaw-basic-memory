# Write Incident Response Runbook

## Observations
- [description] Document incident response procedures based on Feb 12 webhook queue postmortem
- [status] active
- [assigned_to] Atlas
- [started] 2026-02-14
- [current_step] 1
- [priority] medium
- [due_date] 2026-02-17

## Steps
1. [ ] Draft runbook covering: detection, triage, communication, resolution, postmortem
2. [ ] Include specific playbooks for queue backup, database issues, OAuth outages
3. [ ] Review with Maya and Raj
4. [ ] Publish to team docs

## Context
- Action item from Feb 12 webhook queue postmortem
- No existing incident response documentation
- Previous incident took 20 min to resolve — could have been faster with runbook
- Should include escalation paths and on-call rotation once team grows
