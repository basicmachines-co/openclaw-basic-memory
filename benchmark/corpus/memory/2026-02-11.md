# 2026-02-11 — Tuesday

## Observations
- [date] 2026-02-11
- [type] daily-note

## Standup
- Maya shipped webhook queue prototype — 3x throughput improvement on ingestion
- Raj closed STL-142 (connection pooling) and STL-145 (timezone cache key)
- Lena presenting onboarding redesign to Maya at 2pm

## Customer Feedback
- Team at Nexus Labs (12 seats) requesting Jira integration — told them post-v1
- "fasttrack_dev" confirmed timezone fix works — sent us a thank-you tweet
- New trial signup from a YC W26 batch company called "Cortex AI"

## Meeting: Onboarding Redesign Review (2pm)
- Lena's new flow: Install → Connect GitHub → See first metric (3 steps)
- Old flow had 7 steps including email verification, team invite, preference wizard
- Maya approved the simplified flow — "if they can see value in 60 seconds, they'll stay"
- Decision: remove email verification from onboarding, move to settings
- Target: ship new onboarding by Feb 20

## Architecture Discussion
- Maya proposed caching webhook payloads in SQLite before processing
- Advantage: replay capability, audit trail, crash recovery
- Raj concerned about disk usage on high-volume teams
- Compromise: 7-day retention with configurable TTL per team
- Linear workspace ID: ws_stl_prod_7x2k

## Evening
- Pushed v0.8.3 hotfix for the timezone bug
- Release notes drafted and posted to #announcements
