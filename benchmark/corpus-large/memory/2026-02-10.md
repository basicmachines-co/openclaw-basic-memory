# 2026-02-10 — Monday

## Observations
- [date] 2026-02-10
- [type] daily-note

## Standup
- Maya working on Linear webhook integration — parsing cycle time events
- Raj fixing the SQLite connection pooling bug (issue STL-142)
- Lena delivered new onboarding mockups — 3-step flow replacing the current 7-step monster

## Decisions
- Moving webhook processing to background queue (Bull MQ equivalent in Rust)
- Decided to drop support for GitLab in v1 — focus on GitHub + Linear only
- OAuth flow will use PKCE instead of implicit grant (security review finding)

## Bug Report
- User "fasttrack_dev" reported metrics dashboard shows stale data after timezone change
- Root cause: cache key doesn't include timezone offset
- Raj will fix in STL-145

## Claw Time
Read an interesting paper on "Retrieval-Augmented Generation for Knowledge-Intensive NLP Tasks" — the key insight is that combining parametric and non-parametric memory outperforms either alone. Relevant to how we think about metric aggregation caching.
