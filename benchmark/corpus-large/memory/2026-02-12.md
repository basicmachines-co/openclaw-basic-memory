# 2026-02-12 — Wednesday

## Observations
- [date] 2026-02-12
- [type] daily-note

## Standup
- Maya integrating Linear cycle time API — endpoint is rate-limited to 100 req/min
- Raj building webhook replay tool based on yesterday's architecture decision
- Lena started implementing new onboarding UI in the web dashboard

## Metrics Review
- MRR: $2,100 (up from $1,950 last month)
- Active teams: 65 (net +3 this week)
- Churn: 2 teams churned — both cited "not enough integrations"
- Trial-to-paid conversion: 23% (target: 30%)
- GitHub stars: 1,847 (was 1,800 last week)

## Incident
- 14:30 PST: webhook ingestion queue backed up for ~20 minutes
- Root cause: Linear sent a burst of 2,000 events from a large workspace migration
- Raj's fix: added backpressure mechanism with configurable max queue depth
- No data loss, all events eventually processed
- Postmortem scheduled for Friday

## Customer Call: Cortex AI
- CTO James Liu, 8-person engineering team
- They want to track deployment frequency + lead time (DORA metrics)
- Currently using a janky spreadsheet
- Interested in team plan at $9/seat
- Follow-up demo scheduled for Feb 18 at 10am PST
- Email: james@cortexai.dev

## Security
- Dependabot flagged a vulnerability in the HTTP client crate (hyper v0.14)
- Upgraded to hyper v1.2 — breaking changes in connection pooling API
- Raj handling the migration, ETA Thursday
