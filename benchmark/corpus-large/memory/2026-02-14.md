# 2026-02-14 — Friday

## Observations
- [date] 2026-02-14
- [type] daily-note

## Standup
- Maya: Linear integration MVP done — cycle time + throughput metrics working
- Raj: webhook replay tool shipped, hyper v1.2 migration complete
- Lena: onboarding UI 70% done, blocked on OAuth flow changes

## Postmortem: Webhook Queue Backup (Feb 12)
- Timeline: 14:22-14:42 PST, 20 min degradation
- Impact: ~200 teams experienced delayed metric updates
- Root cause: no backpressure on ingestion queue, Linear burst exceeded capacity
- Fix: configurable max queue depth (default 5000), overflow to disk-backed queue
- Action items:
  1. Add queue depth alerting (Maya, by Feb 19)
  2. Load test with simulated burst traffic (Raj, by Feb 21)
  3. Document incident response runbook (Atlas, by Feb 17)
- Severity: P2 (degraded but not down)

## Pricing Discussion
- Maya considering a free tier change: currently unlimited for solo, might cap at 3 repos
- Raj argues against caps — "developers hate artificial limits"
- Decision deferred to next week — want to look at usage data first
- Current pricing: $9/seat/month for teams, free for solo developers
- Enterprise inquiries: 2 (both want SSO + audit logs)

## Deploy
- v0.9.0-beta.1 tagged with Linear integration
- Changelog: Linear cycle time, throughput, backlog age metrics
- Webhook replay tool (admin only)
- Breaking: dropped GitLab support (deprecated in v0.8)

## Relations
